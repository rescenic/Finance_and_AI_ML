### Rules of Numbers

* **Commutative Laws:** $a + b  =  b + a \ \ \ \ a * b  =  b * a \ \ \ \ {a \ \ \\% \ \ of \ \ b}  =  {b \ \ \\% \ \ of \ \ a}$
  * The "Commutative Laws" say we can swap numbers over and still get the same answer
  * Why "commutative" ... ? Because the numbers can travel back and forth like a commuter
  * The Commutative Law does not work for subtraction or division
    * 12 / 3 = 4, but
    * 3 / 12 = 1/4
* **Associative Laws:** $(a + b) + c  =  a + (b + c) \ \ \ \ (a × b) × c  =  a × (b × c)$
  * The "Associative Laws" say that it doesn't matter how we group the numbers (i.e. which we calculate first) ...
  * The Associative Law does not work for subtraction or division:
    * (9 – 4) – 3 = 5 – 3 = 2, but
    * 9 – (4 – 3) = 9 – 1 = 8  
* **Distributive Laws:** $a × (b + c)  =  a × b  +  a × c$
  * We get the same answer when we => multiply a number by a group of numbers added together, or do each multiply separately then add them
  * The Distributive Law does not work for division:
    * 24 / (4 + 8) = 24 / 12 = 2, but
    * 24 / 4 + 24 / 8 = 6 + 3 = 9 

### Rules of Exponents

* **Rule 1 (Product Rule):** $a^m*a^n = a^{m+n}$
* **Rule 2 (Quotient Rule):** $a^m/a^n = a^{m-n}$
* **Rule 3 (Power of a Power Rule):** $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$

### Rules of Logarithms

* **Rule 1 (Product Rule):** $\log{_b}(M*N) = \log{_b}M + \log{_b}N$ [ b, M and N are positive integers and b ≠ 1 ]
* **Rule 2 (Quotient Rule):** $\log{_b}(M/N) = \log{_b}M - \log{_b}N$ [ b, M and N are positive integers and b ≠ 1 ]
* **Rule 3 (Power Rule):** $\log{_b}(M^k) = k*\log{_b}M$ [ b and M are positive numbers, b ≠ 1 and k is a real number ]
* **Rule 4 (Change of Base Rule):** $\log{_b}(M) = \log{_k}M / \log{_k}b$ [ M, b and k are positive numbers and b ≠ 1, k ≠ 1 ]
* **Rule 5 (Reciprocal Rule):** $\log{_b}(M) = 1 / \log{_M}k$ [ M and b are the positive numbers other than 1 ]
* **Rule 6:** $\log{_b}(1) = 0$ [ $b \gt 0$ and $b \neq 1$ ]
* **Rule 7:** $\log{_b}(b) = 1$ [ $b \gt 0$ and $b \neq 1$ ]
* **Rule 8:** $\log{_b}(b^k) = k$ [ $b \gt 0$ and $b \neq 1$ and $k \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{R}$ ]
* **Rule 9:** $b^{\log{_b}(k)} = k$ [ $b \gt 0$ and $b \neq 1$ and $k \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{R}$ ]
